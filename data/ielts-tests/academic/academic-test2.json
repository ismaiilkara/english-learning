                "title": "Reading Passage 1: Archaeologists discover evidence of prehistoric island settlers",
                "content": "<p>In early April 2019, Dr Ceri Shipton and his colleagues from Australian National University became the first archaeologists to explore Obi, one of many tropical islands in Indonesia's Maluku Utara province. The research team's discoveries suggest that the prehistoric people who lived on Obi were adept on both land and sea, hunting in the dense rainforest, foraging on the seashore, and possibly even voyaging between islands .</p><p>Just inland from the village of Kelo on Obi's northern coast, Shipton and his colleagues found two caves containing prehistoric rock shelters that were suitable for excavation. There they found numerous artefacts, including fragments of axes, some dating to about 14,000 years ago. The earliest axes at Kelo were made using clam shells. As on Gebe, it is highly likely that Obi's axes were used in the construction of canoes, thus allowing these early peoples to maintain connections between communities on neighbouring islands .</p><p>The oldest cultural layers from the Kelo site provided the team with the earliest record for human occupation on Obi, dating back around 18,000 years. Sea levels were about 120 metres lower, meaning Obi was a much larger island, encompassing what is today the separate island of Bisa, as well as several other small islands nearby. Roughly 11,700 years ago, as the most recent ice age ended, the climate became significantly warmer and wetter, no doubt making Obi's jungle much thicker. According to the researchers, it is no coincidence that around this time the first axes crafted from stone rather than sea shells appear, likely in response to their heavy-duty use for clearing and modification of the increasingly dense rainforest .</p><p>Shipton's team's excavation of the shelters at the Kelo site unearthed a volcanic glass substance called obsidian, which must have been brought over from another island, as there is no known source on Obi. It also revealed particular types of beads, similar to those previously found on islands in southern Wallacea. These finds again support the idea that Obi islanders routinely travelled to other islands. The excavations suggest people successfully lived in the \u0130wo Kelo shelters for about 10,000 years. But then, about 8,000 years ago, both were abandoned. Whatever the reason for the departure, there is no evidence for use of the Kelo shelters after this time, until about 1,000 years ago, when they were re-occupied by people who owned pottery as well as items made out of gold and silver.</p>",

                "content": "<p>Wetlands are areas where water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the surface of the soil, for all or part of the year. These are complex ecosystems, rich in unique plant and animal life. But according to the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWFN), half of the world's wetlands have disappeared since 1990-converted or destroyed for commercial development, drainage schemes and the extraction of minerals and peat. Many of those that remain have been damaged by agricultural pesticides and fertilisers, industrial pollutants, and construction works .</p><p>Throughout history, humans have gathered around wetlands, and their fertile ecosystems have played an important part in human development. Consequently, they are of considerable religious, historical and archaeological value to many communities around the world. PIeter van Eijk, head of Climate Adaptation at Wetlands International (WI), pointing to their use as buffers that protect coastal areas from sea-level rise and extreme weather events such as hurricanes and flooding .</p><p>Peatlands - wetlands with a waterlogged organic soil layer - are particularly targeted. When peatlands are drained for cultivation, they become net carbon emitters instead of active carbon stores, and, according to Marcel Silvius, head of Climate-smart Land-use at WI, this practice causes six per cent of all global carbon emissions. The clearance of peatlands for planting also increases the risk of forest fires, which release huge amounts of CO2.</p><p>The damage starts when logging companies arrive to clear the trees. They dig ditches to enter the peat swamps by boat and then float the logs out the same way. These are then used to drain water out of the peatlands to allow for the planting of corn, oil palms or pulpwood trees. Meanwhile, the remainder of the solid matter in the peat starts to move downwards, in a process known as subsidence. Dr Dave Tickner of the WWFN believes that more subtle impacts can be even more devastating. Sediment run-off and fertilisers can be pretty invisible. Awareness of the importance of wetlands is growing, according to McCartney.</p>",

                "title": "Reading Passage 3: Is the era of artificial speech translation upon us?",
                "content": "<p>Noise, Alex Waibel tells me, is one of the major challenges that artificial speech translation has to meet. A device may be able to recognise speech in a laboratory, but will struggle to cope with background noise. At Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Waibel and his colleagues already give lectures in German that their students can follow in English via an electronic translator. It helps that lecturers say much the same thing each year.</p><p>The idea of artificial speech translation has been around for a long time. Douglas Adams' novel, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, published in 1979, featured a life form called the 'Babel fish' which enabled a listener to understand any language. Now devices that look like prototype Babel fish have started to appear. Andrew Ochoa, founder of Waverly Labs, observes that professionals are less inclined to be patient in a conversation. For a conversation, both speakers need to have devices called Pilots (translator earpieces) in their ears. 'We find that there's a barrier with sharing one of the earphones with a stranger,' says Ochoa .</p><p>A translation system needs to be simultaneous rather than in sections that oblige speakers to pause. Systems not only need to cope with physical challenges such as noise, they will also need to be socially aware by addressing people in the right way. Etiquette-sensitive artificial translators could relieve people of the need to know differing cultural norms. Even if voice-morphing technology simulates the speaker's voice, their lip movements won't match, and they will look like they are in a dubbed movie. The contrast will underline the value of shared languages, and the value of learning them. Software will never be a substitute for the subtle but vital understanding that comes with knowledge of a language.</p>",
