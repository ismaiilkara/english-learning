Well, I'm the coordinator, so I can give you some information.\nWOMAN: Is it a course?\nGARY: No, it's a group for people who can already play a bit and want to play together.\nWOMAN: I see. My name's Mary, by the way. What's your surname, Gary?\nGARY: It's POUNCE, P-O-U-N-C-E.\nMARY: Right. And what level should I be?\nGARY: Well, we have three different groups. One is for intermediate players.\nMARY: That's me.\nGARY: Good. We meet in the library in Arnos Vale.\nMARY: Oh, I know it. It's on Hadley Street, isn't it?\nGARY: That's right. We're there on Thursday mornings.\nMARY: What time?\nGARY: From 10.30 till 11.15.\nMARY: OK. And is there a website I can look at?\nGARY: Well, I'd recommend a site called 'The perfect player'. It's got lots of information for guitarists.\nMARY: Thanks. What do you do in the sessions?\nGARY: Well, we spend about five minutes tuning our guitars, either using an app or a digital tuner. Then we do ten minutes' strumming – practicing different rhythms while the teacher plays the chords.\nMARY: Right.\nGARY: Then we spend about 15 minutes on songs we all know. Usually we listen to a recording first.\nMARY: That sounds like fun.\nGARY: It is. Then we spend ten minutes playing together, then we have a solo where one person plays and the rest of us listen.\nMARY: I'd be too nervous for that!\nGARY: You don't have to do it! Finally, we spend five minutes noting things to practice at home.\nMARY: OK. Well, I think I'll come along next Thursday."

I worked long hours and I was getting a bit fed up with it. I'd always had a hobby – sailing – and I wanted to do more of that, so I decided to move to Northsea. I've got a much better work-life balance now.\n\nWhen I arrived, I went to see the local lifeboat station. It's a new building, and it's very impressive. It was actually paid for by a local resident who'd won a lot of money and wanted to do something for the town.\n\nI decided to apply to be a volunteer. First, I had a health assessment. The doctor was happy with my general health, but he was a bit concerned that I was short-sighted. However, once I'd explained that I always wear contact lenses, he said that was fine.\n\nI had to do some training, of course. We had a residential course, which was very good. It really helped to build my mental strength, which is so important when you're out at sea in a storm. We also had a session in a wave tank, which was great for practicing survival techniques.\n\nWhen we get a call-out, we have to get to the station as quickly as possible. Our target is to launch the boat within six to eight minutes of getting the call. Once we're on the boat, my role is as 'helmsman'. That means I have the responsibility of deciding if the lifeboat should be launched, depending on the weather conditions.\n\nAs well as going out on the lifeboat, I also give talks on safety at sea to local groups. It's a great way to meet people and raise awareness of what we do. I find the work very motivating, especially working as part of a team. There's a real sense of community among the volunteers. We also get a lot of support from the local people, and it's always nice when we're thanked by those we've helped."

I found an article that said 300 million pairs of shoes are thrown away every year in the UK.\nDON: That's incredible. I thought the topic might be too limited in scope, but there's actually a lot to look at.\nBELLA: I know. And when it comes to trainers, I think they're especially interesting because they're so popular among young people.\nDON: True, but we don't always agree on everything. For example, you think they're suitable for school, but I think they wear out too quickly.\nBELLA: Well, they are comfortable. I sometimes recycle my shoes because they no longer fit.\nDON: I do it because I've grown out of them. I was confused by one article I read, though. It said that although public consumption of footwear has risen, less footwear is recycled now than in the past.\nBELLA: That's strange. I wonder why. I spoke to a recycling manager and he gave me some reasons why they have to reject footwear.\nDON: What did he say?\nBELLA: Well, for high-heeled shoes, it's often because one shoe is missing.\nDON: And for ankle boots?\nBELLA: They're often rejected because the stitching is broken.\nDON: What about baby shoes?\nBELLA: He said they're often brand new, so they're not really being recycled – they're just being given away.\nDON: And trainers?\nBELLA: They're often too dirty to be reused.\nDON: I see. I also read about a project to make 'new' shoes out of old shoes, but it failed.\nBELLA: Why?\nDON: Because the shoes in the 'new' pairs were not completely alike.\nBELLA: I suppose that's a problem. But I think we can present our topic from a new angle.\nDON: I agree."

They are also called 'moss piglets'. There are more than 1,000 species, and they are between 0.05 and 1.2 millimetres long.\n\nIn terms of physical appearance, they have a head and a round body with four pairs of legs. Each leg has claws for gripping. They don't have respiratory organs. Instead, their body is filled with a liquid that carries both oxygen and blood. Their mouth is shaped like a tube, with teeth called stylets.\n\nTardigrades are found all over the world, often at the bottom of a lake or on plants. They are very resilient and can exist in very low or high temperatures. In dry conditions, they roll into a ball called a 'tun'. This is a state known as cryptobiosis. They stay alive with a much lower metabolism than usual. A type of protein ensures their DNA is not damaged. Research is underway to find out how many days they can stay alive in space.\n\nWhen it comes to feeding, they consume liquids, for example from moss or algae. Some species also eat other tardigrades. Finally, in terms of their conservation status, they are not considered to be endangered."
