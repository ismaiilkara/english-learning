                        "content": "<p>Here are some of the frequently asked questions about the tram service in Gobridge town:</p><p><strong>When do the trams run?</strong></p><p>Gobridge Tramlink operates a network of trams that run throughout the year and provide links to main services, stations and the airport. Timetables are reviewed in October and March, and may alter slightly so check before you travel. Our first tram from the city centre leaves from Marvin Square at 6.30 am, half an hour after the first city bus service.</p><p><strong>Can I get a tram from the airport?</strong></p><p>Trams from the airport to the city centre start running at 6.15 am and leave every fifteen minutes until 7.30 pm when the evening schedule takes over. Trams then run to the main railway station at 35-minute intervals and end at 11.35 pm. If your flight arrives later than this, the number 207 airport bus runs every hour through the night.</p><p><strong>What do I do if I don't have a ticket?</strong></p><p>Tickets are not sold by anyone on the tram. Ticket vending machines are located at all tram shelters. Check your route and make sure you buy the correct price ticket. If the vending machine does not work, you should push the red button on the machine and speak into the microphone. A member of staff will either fix the machine straight away or contact the tram inspector onboard your tram. He or she cannot sell you a ticket, but you will not be obliged to pay the £8 on-board fine for not having one.</p><p><strong>Can I take my bike on the tram?</strong></p><p>Each tram is licensed to carry a maximum of two bicycles, though drivers may refuse to allow cyclists to get on if the tram is crowded. Bicycles may only be taken on the trams during off-peak travel periods: up to 7.30 am, between 10 am and 2.30 pm and after 7 pm. Festivals and other large events may also mean that bicycles are prohibited as trams carry extra passengers at these times. Once on board, riders should remain with their bicycles throughout the journey and ensure they do not obstruct the entrance, exit or any other area of public access.</p>",

It's a long sweater but that's good as I'm quite tall. I normally find that the sleeves are too short when I try on a top, but not with this one. I tend to take medium but went for large, which was a wise decision as there is plenty of room for a T-shirt underneath when I wear it with jeans.</p><p><strong>B Davina</strong></p><p>These sweaters are an ideal weight for office wear. The purple one is pretty, though I expected a lighter shade from the picture. I wear a US size 12 /UK 16, and the medium is big enough to fit over a shirt with room to spare. It has long sleeves that I love to roll up at the wrist. I'm now trying to resist the temptation to buy it in grey too.</p><p><strong>C Naga</strong></p><p>This knitted sweater looks great in the pictures. I ordered the olive green with stripes and, although I wasn't sure it was going to look right on me, I was pleasantly surprised when I put it on. It's very soft and I love the long past-the-wrist sleeves too. I opted for the medium, but it was too tight so I exchanged it.</p><p><strong>D Libby</strong></p><p>This is the third of your sweaters that I've bought over the past two years. It's true to size and perfect for the winter months, though I should add that its loose knit means it's best to avoid playing with cats or young dogs when you're wearing it as they could pull threads in the body or sleeves.</p><p><strong>E Laura</strong></p><p>I couldn't decide which colour to get so I bought the deep blue and the charcoal grey, with every intention of sending one of them back. That didn't happen, of course! I would say both colours match the online pictures. I bought size small, and the length is perfect for me, despite the unnecessarily long sleeves! These sweaters are lovely to wear with jeans but also stylish enough to wear to work.</p>",

                        "content": "<p>Stepping into a new management role can be unnerving. Here's how to inspire your team: Set the tone of your leadership style from the outset. Be confident, self-assured and respectful with everyone you meet. Speak as you want to be spoken to, and remember to listen. The first few weeks is when people develop their perceptions of you, so work hard to earn their <strong>trust</strong>. This will be key to effective change and progress.</p><p>Part of a leader's brief is to set bold <strong>goals</strong>. They could take years to achieve, but they need to be specific enough that everyone in the organisation understands them, buys into them and is willing to work together to achieve them.</p><p>Don't do everything yourself. Great leaders surround themselves with talented individuals and they should trust them to make things happen. If things need changing, tell people and involve them in making the changes by participating in the design of a new <strong>strategy</strong>. If the team is too cautious to embrace change, give them one more chance but be clearer about what you want.</p><p>Stamp out the 'them and us' culture. In many organisations, employees feel distant from senior management. The message must be plain: we all work together, but leaders need to work hard to ensure this filters through to everyone in the organisation.</p><p>Allow time for innovation. It's important to give staff time to come up with new ideas and <strong>solutions</strong> that will fix new problems. However, be clear that a decision is expected; set a time limit and stick to it.</p><p>It is likely that the formula that makes the business you are managing successful will have been created many years ago - but it's important to remember how the business started. Honour those early pioneers and instil a sense of <strong>pride</strong> across the organisation.</p><p>Leaders need to accept that some <strong>risk</strong> may be required if the situation calls for it. Playing it safe is never a good business rule, and leaders must make sure their business stays ahead by being prepared to act quickly.</p><p>Show you are passionate and enthusiastic. People spend a large part of their lives working for an organisation, and having a leader who is genuinely thrilled about its <strong>future</strong> is hugely inspiring.</p>",

But it's arguably changing at a faster rate now than at any previous moment in its history. And emojis - the set of picture characters that people use to punctuate their online correspondence - are at the forefront of this frenzy for change. As a form of global communication, emojis only began their growth in 2011. Four years later, it was estimated that they were being used by over 90 per cent of the online population. In excess of six billion were being sent every day. Their prevalence in the culture was such that Oxford Dictionaries recently chose one as their word of the year. 'Words of the Year' are those judged to be reflective of the 'ethos, mood, or preoccupations of that particular year'. They're very much of their time. And often, once that time has passed, they fade from people's consciousness almost as quickly as they arose."

But the reasons for this offer a fascinating insight into the way that society is evolving. The little yellow circle with dots for eyes acts as a surprisingly good lens through which to view the history of human communication, and to predict its future. There are two main reasons why language changes. One is to do with the way that language mirrors the changes in how we relate to each other. As an expression of identity, language is adapted by different groups and different generations to reflect their own sense of self. It also needs to constantly assimilate fresh concepts as these evolve. Words are being created for these reasons all the time. But what's interesting about emojis is that they've contributed to this ever-expanding storehouse in a different way. At this point in our history, the gaps in our vocabulary are being filled not simply by new words, but by an absolutely new system of expression."

Both hardware and new technologies result in us subtly changing the way we interact with each other and also altering the shape of the language we use."

In particular, they compensate for the way that computer-mediated messaging on smartphones can sometimes tend towards the emotionally empty. Whereas face-to-face, or even voice-to-voice, conversations can express emotional closeness through facial expression or tone of voice, this is easy to miss when messages are rendered in a few short words on a small screen. Emojis are a means of restoring this emotional framing to an interaction - punctuating your message with a smile. But unlike almost any other type of language system, emojis have something akin to a built-in obsolescence. Just as smartphones and their operating systems have a frequent refresh rate, emojis also get routine enhancements. The emojis you have on your phone now will undergo subtle redesigns over the course of time, and extra characters will be added. Because of this, their usefulness is artificially limited. In the context of communication systems, this is something that's never previously been the case. Twenty years ago, people might have bought a new landline phone when they were tired of the design of their old phone or if they wanted to get one with whatever latest innovation was going around - an inbuilt answering machine, say. But they didn't have to upgrade the language they were using as well."

Moreover, the fact that they're at the front line of a relentless wave of technologically driven change in communications practices encourages - if not necessitates - a great amount of creativity in the way they're used. Finally, there's the way they've become implicated in almost all aspects of modern society, from politics and marketing to art and entertainment. Emojis are the subject of musicals and Hollywood films. They're the inspiration for fashion design, art and architecture. They're a staple in advertising and commerce. Understanding why they've become so popular, and how they work, can not only explain something about the nature of language; it can also help us to understand our relationship with technology, society and ourselves."
