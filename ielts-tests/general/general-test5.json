There are no steep hills and it's perfect for a leisurely afternoon. The path is well-shaded by trees throughout, making it ideal for hot summer days. Dogs are welcome but must be kept on leads at all times.</p><p><strong>B Highfield Ridge</strong></p><p>A challenging 5-mile route with spectacular views. The path climbs steeply in places so a reasonable level of fitness is required. There is little shelter from the sun along the exposed ridge. Several benches are placed at viewpoints where you can rest and admire the scenery.</p><p><strong>C Riverside Trail</strong></p><p>Follow the river for 4 miles through meadows and past a bird hide where you can observe local wildlife. Dogs may run freely in designated areas. Picnic tables are available at the halfway point.</p><p><strong>D Lakeside Loop</strong></p><p>An easy 2-mile circular walk around the lake. The wildlife observation platform offers excellent views of nesting waterfowl. There is one short steep section near the dam. Dogs must be on leads near the wildlife areas.</p><p><strong>E Moorland Path</strong></p><p>A 6-mile route across open moorland with very little shade. The terrain is mostly flat but can be boggy after rain. You may choose to take the shorter 3-mile alternative if conditions are difficult. Dogs are not permitted due to ground-nesting birds.</p>",

I needed somewhere to live quickly, so I contacted several letting agents. Poppi Properties got back to me the fastest and arranged for me to see a flat the very next day. When I arrived, there were already two other people waiting to view it, but I was taken in first. The flat was on the third floor - I had hoped for one higher up with better views, but it was in my price range so I decided to take it.</p><p>The letting agent, Lillee, was friendly and helpful from the start and continued to be so throughout my time there. She arranged for the place to be cleaned before I moved in and even helped me carry some boxes upstairs. The flat came fully furnished which was ideal for me as I didn't have much of my own furniture at that point.</p><p>After living there for about a year, I noticed that the carpets were looking quite worn. I mentioned this to Lillee and she arranged for them to be professionally cleaned at no extra cost to me. The landlord kept the rent at the same level during my entire tenancy which I really appreciated. After two and a half years I decided to buy my own place and moved out. I would definitely recommend Poppi Properties to anyone looking for rented accommodation.</p>",

Here's how the process typically works.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Initial approach</strong></p><p>First, you should ask to speak to your immediate manager on an informal basis. Explain the problem and try to find a solution between you. If this doesn't work, you should look up your company's formal grievance procedure. This is usually contained in a handbook, a noticeboard or sometimes on the company intranet.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Put it in writing</strong></p><p>You will need to write to your employer setting out the details of your complaint. You may also wish to suggest a solution to the problem. Make sure your letter is dated and keep a copy for yourself.</p><p><strong>Step 3: The meeting</strong></p><p>Your employer should then arrange a meeting to discuss your grievance. You have the legal right to bring someone with you to this meeting. This could be a colleague or an official from your trade union.</p><p><strong>Step 4: The decision</strong></p><p>After the meeting, your employer must inform you of their decision in writing. If you are unhappy with the outcome, you have the right to appeal.</p><p><strong>Step 5: The appeal</strong></p><p>If you decide to appeal, your employer should arrange another meeting. Ideally, this should be chaired by a manager who is senior to the one who made the original decision.</p><p><strong>Step 6: Further action</strong></p><p>If you remain dissatisfied after the appeal, you may consider other options such as mediation. In some cases, you may wish to take your complaint to an employment tribunal. However, you should be aware that there are strict time limits for doing this - normally within three months of the event you are complaining about.</p>",

                        "content": "<p>In a residential building such as a block of flats, underfloor jobs that involve plumbing mechanical and electrical systems are common. They may need to take place in a narrow space that is often only about 35 cm deep. In addition the floors are typically covered with a wood product, engineered to resemble solid wood that has very strict criteria as far as drilling and cutting are concerned. The plumber cannot just go in and cut holes and lay pipes. He must first think about what he is doing read and understand the cutting chart that accompanies each of his tools and visualise how his work will impact on other tradespeople before proceeding.</p><p>Commercial plumbers working on office buildings, hotels, restaurants etc. have the same issues and coordination problems as residential plumbers but often have to install equipment that is more sophisticated. This is because it forms part of integrated systems where mechanical work and plumbing work are combined. The equipment will have specific installation instructions so it is critical that the plumber has the cognitive ability to understand these. In addition often the structures are complex, and the floors and walls must be X-rayed prior to drilling in order to avoid hitting key elements such as reinforcing steel.</p><p>Service plumbers go in where others have been and often face situations where they must troubleshoot various possible causes of a plumbing problem. In order to do this effectively they must have complete knowledge of say a customer's shower until they are servicing even if they did not install it. They must have the ability to translate the symptoms they can see such as leaks and blockages into the actual problem and then take the appropriate action to rectify the issue in a fast and cost-effective way. Often service plumbers encounter residential or commercial customers who are either facing great inconvenience or have had their operations severely disrupted because of a plumbing issue. Successful service plumbers not only need good mechanical skills but they typically need very good people skills to provide necessary support.</p>",

Here we look at some of the methods being used.</p><p><strong>Captive breeding programmes</strong></p><p>When a species is critically endangered, zoos and wildlife parks sometimes step in to help by breeding animals in captivity. The aim is usually to release the animals back into the wild once numbers have recovered. For this to work, vets and animal keepers need to ensure the animals remain healthy and are able to breed successfully.</p><p><strong>Habitat protection</strong></p><p>Perhaps the most important thing we can do to protect wildlife is to preserve their natural habitats. Many species live in pairs or in family groups, and they need sufficient territory to find food and raise their young. Destroying forests or draining wetlands removes the places where animals can live and find food.</p><p><strong>Reintroduction programmes</strong></p><p>Once a species has been bred in captivity, or if a population has been wiped out in one area but survives elsewhere, animals may be released into suitable habitat. Before this happens, scientists must ensure the area has enough food for the animals, and that the threats which caused the original decline have been removed.</p><p><strong>Research and monitoring</strong></p><p>Understanding animal behaviour is crucial for conservation. Scientists study how animals find food, where they travel, and how they interact with their environment. Some species undergo a period of hibernation during winter months, and researchers need to understand these patterns to protect them effectively.</p><p><strong>Community involvement</strong></p><p>Local communities often play a vital role in conservation. When people understand the value of wildlife, they are more likely to protect it. Many conservation projects now work closely with local villages, providing employment and education opportunities.</p>",
